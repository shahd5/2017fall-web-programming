My computer experience  - 
So far I’ve worked/know 
•	Core Java
•	JavaFX
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	Ajax
•	API
•	MySQL
Heard of  - 
•	Angular
•	MongoDB

•	Php
•	Json
•	JQuery
So all this summer I was working on a project. It was to practice and make the learning experience fun. 
In a nutshell the project was  - I made an desktop application where many user puts in details and then information is reviewed and approved by a some other authority. Some of the detail can be put from a website (HTML,CSS,JavaScript and php just to connect to MySql). All the user information was stored in a database. The data was stored in Mysql database and the application was developed in javafx. I realized javafx was not a good platform to create UI.  (Lack of knowledge, but again the scope of the project was to learn and make it fun so no regrets.) 
Since javaFX was not a good platform, this class will help me to solve the problem. One of the main feature that was missing in the application was Ajax. I’m looking forward to make this java application into a web application. I was happy to know that we will cover AngularJS. Creating a single page application will be awesome.  
I’ve several project that can be done with the knowledge I’ll gain from this class. One of them is to improve student registration for classes in SUNY New Paltz. Currently we need to open 3 tabs to register for a class. What I’ve in mind is to make it all happen on one page with many more features. I’ll talk more about it when I see you. (Trying to keep it short)  
Lastly excited to make the fitness tracking app. Also the final exam sounds fun. This might be the first time I’ll enjoy giving finals. Lol
Good Day !!
